# Practical Notes

## 💳 Money

All four countries are essentially cashless. Card (Visa/Mastercard) works everywhere, including market stalls. **One exception: Tvättomaten laundromat in Stockholm — cash only** for the machines.

## 🍺 Drink Prices

Budget €8–12 per beer in Helsinki and Norway. Stockholm and Copenhagen slightly less painful but still ≥€7. Wine and cocktails €12–18+. This is normal — don't let it ruin your night.

## ☀️ Daylight

Mid-June this far north: ~19 hours of daylight in Stockholm, almost 24 in Helsinki. Sun barely dips below the horizon. Bring an eye mask for sleeping.

## 📋 Reservations

Helsinki especially is a "reservation culture." If you want dinner at a specific restaurant, book it. BasBas Kulma and LKK can book up weeks ahead in summer.

## 🌧️ Rain Gear

Bergen gets rain ~260 days/year. Pack a light waterproof layer. Other cities can get June showers too.

## 🧺 Laundry

**Tvättomaten** — Västmannagatan 61, Stockholm (near Odenplan T-bana). Mon–Fri 8:30–18:30, Sat 9:30–13:00. ~100 SEK/load including soap + drying. **Cash only.** Staff speaks English.
